## About the Book
This book is aimed to teach the readers how to design RAML APIs using Anypoint Platform. It also focuses on popular topics such as System Integration, API Led Connectivity, and Centre for Enablement and RAML. It will show how to use, call and test free mock REST APIs. The readers can also work with some commercially available license-based APIs.
Furthermore, the book will explain most of the examples provided by RAML.org so that you can simulate it from your local system. This book will then help you develop your RESTful API specification for adding, retrieving, updating and deleting data for a business entity. Later, you will learn how to use the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform Designer for designing and simulating your RAML API design specifications. By the end, you will be able to develop an end to end RAML API using the MuleSoft Anypoint Studio.
